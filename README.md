My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions and utils.

The solutions are in the `advent_of_code/notebooks/<YEAR>.ipynb` notebooks. The AOC Jupyter magic (`%%aoc <day> <part>`) automatically submits and verifies the answers produced by the code there. Unfortunately, Jupyter magics seem to break Github's code highlighting. Oh well, not much I can do.

To run on your inputs, put your AoC cookie in `data/tokens.txt` and run the notebook. Note that the notebook will automatically submit the answers, so the problems will get marked as "solved" by you on AOC website.
